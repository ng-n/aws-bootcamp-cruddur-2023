# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Tasks 
1. Run Dockerfile CMD as an external script
2. Push and tag a image to DockerHub
3. Use multi-stage building for a Docker build
4. Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
5. Install Docker on the local machine and get the same containers running outside Gitpod / Codespaces
6. Launch an EC2 instance that has Docker installed, and pull a container to run your own Docker processes

## Task 1: Running Dockerfile CMD as an external script

 In a Dockerfile, the 'CMD' instruction is used to specify the command that should be run when a container is started from the image. 
    ```
        CMD ["python3", "-m", "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=4567"]
    ```
 By default, the command will run the Python3 interpreter and execute flask inside the container's filesystem.

 To run the 'CMD' as an external script, it is required to create a Bash/Py file and specify the script's path to the filename instead of the abovementioned command.

   1. Create a Bash script, named ```'script.sh'``` for the backend-flask
        ```
            #!/bin/bash

            python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
        ```
   2. Modify the CMD command in the Dockerfile
        ```
                CMD ["./script.sh"]
        ```
   3. Build a Docker image with versioning control
        ```
        docker build -t backend-flask:1.0 .
        ```
   4. Run the Docker 
        ``` 
            docker run -p 4567:4567 backend-flask:1.0
        ```
